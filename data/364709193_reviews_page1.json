You used to just have collections be a list that as you clicked each one, it showed the collection, then click the next, and it showed. \n\nNow when you click out of a collection, you’re back to square one. What used to take seconds now takes minutes. Go back to the UI from ios17. You made it so you have to create far too many clicks. \n\nYou always screw up good things. It’s almost like you can’t help yourselves. You had a great navigation system in 17 for collections but you had to make it 10 times more difficult. Whatever genius thought that was a good idea should be fired immediately. They obviously aren’t fit for the job. I have over 2000 books and pdfs sorted by collection and you just slowed me down to a crawl. \n\nYou deserve zero stars.",

You have to export/share it one by one.  3. This stupid app even adds copyright  warning on your own notes exported/shared.  Don’t waste your life on this reader-hostile app.",

    "text": "I gave Books a try after Kindle’s latest update turned the Kindle iOS app into a hot mess. Unfortunately, pasting text from Books into note-taking apps, like Apple Notes, also always pastes a citation with the name of the book and author -every time- and there’s no way to turn this off.\n\nThis makes the Books app worthless to me, since I frequently summarize highlights across a book (or multiple books and articles) into notes about a subject that I can then reference for many years.\n\nOtherwise, I found the elegance of Books to be a refreshing change from the clutter and awkward interface of the Kindle app. But, like I said, it’s worthless if I can’t paste highlights into notes without citations destroying these notes.",

Now when I remove downloads to my 50gb iCloud the next time I open Books they have been downloaded again. Why?! It doesn’t seem to matter what I do in Settings they keep reappearing. I paid for these downloads and I don’t want to have to actually delete them.\nI did go to Apple Community and ask for help and someone said that iCloud is only meant to sync to devices. If that is so why am I paying for storage space?? I have used 13gb of 50 so it can’t be an issue of space. This aggravation has only started to happen in the past few weeks.\nI have an iPhone 15pro max and all the current updates. I have an older iPad that I actually deleted Books from so the only place these files exist is my phone. Recently I began moving them to Files on my iPhone also in case they just start disappearing for some random reason.  I am fast losing my love for this app.",
